This program details my first attempt at 3D game development in Godot, specifically in creating an environment which includes an archway constructed out of combining various 3D bodies, as well as implementing a directional sunlight effect
There is also a player scene which allows user input to move around the space, and most of the brains behind this is in the respective script file attached
There are some tweaks I could make to smooth out the arch body even more as well as make the camera sensitivity less clunky and changeable according to the user's wish. But for my first foray into the 3D side of things, I have learned a lot that I can utilize
